That brings me to the end of my presentation<br>
Are there any questions?<br>
That's a fair point<br>
That's confidential<br>
The questioner would like to know<br>
That's not really my field<br>
I can <strong>put</strong> you <strong>in touch with</strong> someone<br>
I think that <strong>goes beyond the scope</strong> of today's ...<br>
I'm afraid, we've run out of time<br>
I think that's good place to stop.<br>
Thanks you for listening.<br>
<br>
