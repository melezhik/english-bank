Globalization is good for business.. agree or disagree.
=======================================================

I am not a business persion to speak much about the topic, but I'd like
to share my thoughts on this. This is not going to a formal, academic post
but let's go ahead.

What do people usally mean by saying world "Globalization"? I'd imagine
a global companies all around the world, like Google or Apple or even Coca Cola, 
and then it seems everbody nowadays knows what they are.

Well, in my childhood I did not even hear any of mentioned ones. The first time
I tasted a Cola was about being at pre university teenage days, my oldest brother
brought some stuff to when occasionally came back from Saint-Petersburg to our small town. 
It seemed like a new age by those time, but .. well, it's probably another story, I don't
wnat to destract your attention more and will try to keep tight to the main line of my speaking.

What I like about globalization, this what I could say a _conventional things_,
eveyone gets familiar with, like every time comming to supermarket ( is another aspect of globalization, huh ? ) 
you don't need to choose what pill to take - blue or red one ( like we know _the hero_ does in an somewhat related move ). 
Finally, all the products get prepared and arranged in order and get ready to being consumped by anxios customer.
Thus, as we know - time is money ( yet another thing due to our globalized world )
we don't have to stress our mind and just get another bottle of Coka Colla or bar of Sneaker - 
whenever we are feel thirsty or hungry - indeed junk, unhealthy food BUT so comfortable and so close 
to our minds. 

I haven't told you - I've got a vendor machine in upper floor, it's handy when I miss my lanch hours or when being in 
working rush. 

Just an opposite picture raises from my memories though the early childhood experience. 
We had two, maybe three options to go, that is it! One bread laid and prepared
on dull wood shelves for disciplined and not picky Soviet Union customers, an unifed clothers and boots, 
you should have seen my boy's boots we called "boticks" - a fantastic Soviet Union fashion
style example. A unified and hopeless mainstream with no alternatives at all ( but strange thing
that we were happy not having a Google and IPads in our hands ). And after all a unified but so strict life.

The world where getting a tiny piece of chewing gum from lucky mates who's parrents 
were able to get a foreign contries was a fantastic thing to made my day or even week. 

As humans beings we are always in a rush to get and more of our life. It's endless
race. I am not by no means a bussines person. I'm sorry my dear reader, but I only can see the subject
in context of alone customer living of the world of industrial and interprise giants, 
as probably many of us does. 

And when comming to yet another BIG supermarket, I feel like someone has already find a soltion for my day meal
or weekley menu and weekend entertaiment ( this going to be another Mat Daemon block buster ).

But I am still missing my small town world where I grew up reflecting at cloudy northen horizon 
and treating the life as global micarle and/but by no means as global super market with prdefined choice.
