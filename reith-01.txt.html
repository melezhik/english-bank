<strong>prosperous</strong> beef butchers <br>
<strong>secular</strong> building <br>
<strong>secular</strong> education<br>
modern <strong>secular</strong> society<br>
<strong>shed light</strong> on the interpretation<br>
the lamp <strong>shed</strong> a yellow glow onto the desk<br>
she was <strong>glowing</strong> with happiness<br>
the <strong>glow</strong> from the dying fire lit his face <br>
we saw a lamp <strong>glowing</strong> in the garden<br>
<strong>obsession with the past</strong> can lead to tragedy<br>
a healthy rosy <strong>glow</strong> in her cheeks<br>
her supervisor gave her a <strong>glowing reference</strong><br>
his cigarette <strong>glowed</strong> in the dark <br>
he speaks of you in <strong>glowing terms</strong><br>
around the new year of 1928<br>
<strong>the city of</strong> Danzig<br>
it was a sort of <strong>outhouse</strong> attached to a school<br>
he's <strong>unable to afford</strong> the three rooms<br>
the space into which she moved was <strong>meant</strong> only for temporary use<br>
it <strong>measures</strong> 7 feet <strong>by</strong> 15<br>
it was <strong>furnished with</strong> a stove, a stool, a bed and a table<br>
where the young woman <strong>settled down</strong> to talk with the dead<br>
... as her <strong>commitment</strong> to the past turned to obsession<br>
history chewed her up and spat her out<br>
<br>
